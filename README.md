# SpamEmailClassification
This project is a Precision Spam Email Classification System that utilizes both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to accurately differentiate spam and non-spam(ham) emails, with a strong emphasis on precision to minimize false positives. By preprocessing email text data and transforming it into a suitable numerical format (using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings), the system employs a combination of traditional ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) and advanced DL models (LSTM, CNN) to capture intricate patterns in email content. Precision-focused evaluation metrics (such as precision, recall, and F1 score) are used to ensure high accuracy, making the classifier reliable and suitable for real-world applications. The project is implemented with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, and is designed for easy adaptability across various platforms.
